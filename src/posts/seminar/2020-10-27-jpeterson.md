The Berry-Esseen estimates give quantitative error estimates on the CLT for sums of i.i.d. random variables, and the polynomial decay rate for the error depends on moment bounds of the i.i.d. random variables with the optimal $1/\sqrt{n}$ rate of convergence obtained under a third moment assumption. In this talk we will prove quantitative error bounds for quenched CLTs of both the position and hitting times of one dimensional random walks in random environments (RWRE). For the quantitative CLTs for the hitting times we prove that our rates our optimal. This talk is based on joint works with Sungwon Ahn.
